# Ops-FrontDesk-Management-App

This application came from the idea that most of the front-desk people in my community are using huge books and lots of papers to record entries in a building, store or some sort of public space for security reasons.

I created this app to help frontdesk people use the technology the are familliar with to accomplish the same task with just a software. No papers, no huge books, no pens, just a phone, a tablet or a computer and some database doing the dirty work for you!!

# What I learned

From building this app I learned a lot about asynchronous programing with Javescript and AJAX to fetch data from the server and keep the user joyful.

I learned a lot about the Handlebars template language since I used it to render the data recieved form my view function into beautifull cards with visitor details.

Most of all I learned and improve my understanding of the Flask framework, the python language and the Postgresql Database System.

# What I used

To build this project I could use different tools and techniques, here are my choices:

* Flask, for the backed
* Postgresql, for datastorage
* Javascript, for the frontend
* Ajax, async request
* Handlebards, templating language
* Flask SQlalchemy
* For other dependencies check requirements.txt
