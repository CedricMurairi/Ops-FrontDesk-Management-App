# Ops-FrontDesk-Management-App

This application came from the idea that most of the front-desk people in my community are using huge books and lots of papers to record entries in a building, store, or some public space for security reasons.

I created this app to help front desk people use the technology they are familiar with to accomplish the same task with just software. No papers, no huge books, no pens, just a phone, a tablet or a computer and some database, doing the dirty work for you!!

# What I learned

From building this app, I learned a lot about asynchronous programming with Javascript and AJAX to fetch data from the server and keep the user joyful.

I learned a lot about the Handlebars template language since I used it to render the data received from my view function into beautiful cards with visitor details.

I learned and improved my understanding of the Flask framework, the python language, and the Postgresql Database System.

# What I used

To build this project, I could use different tools and techniques; here are my choices:

* Flask, for the backed
* Postgresql, for datastorage
* Javascript, for the frontend
* Ajax, async request
* Handlebards, templating language
* Flask SQlalchemy
* For other dependencies check requirements.txt
